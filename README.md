## SLAI app platform onboarding (demofsi)

This repo is wired for `slai-app-platform` (`.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml`
+ `deploy/slai-app-prod/demofsi/`). Two fixes were made to
`FSI_StockAnalysis_vLLM.py` for this to work as a container:

- `VLLM_API_BASE` and `MODEL_NAME` now read from env vars (were hardcoded to
  `http://localhost:8003/v1`) — set via the `demofsi-app-secrets` Secret.
  **Currently a placeholder** (`http://CHANGE-ME:8000/v1`) — update
  `deploy/slai-app-prod/demofsi/secrets.enc.yaml` once a real ROCm vLLM
  endpoint exists.
- Gradio's `server_port` was hardcoded to `7861`, which didn't match the
  Dockerfile's `EXPOSE 7860` — now reads `PORT` (default `7860`), and
  `share=True`/`debug=True` are off (no public gradio.live tunnel in
  production).

To onboard: set up GitHub Actions secrets/variables on this repo per
`skills/slai-app-creator/SKILL.md` §1c (`SLAI_APP_DEV_PR_TOKEN`,
`HARBOR_USERNAME`, `HARBOR_PASSWORD`; variables `APP_ID=demofsi`,
`IMAGE_NAME=demofsi`, `BUILD_CONTEXT=.`), then Actions → Deploy prod → Run
workflow.
